For instance, is it primarily through paid advertising like PPC, general organic traffic from search engines, or perhaps you have a noticeable social media presence bringing people in?

Pade search is our big one. Google Ads is the MVP. We get a few leads from Instagram to.

Are there any other major ways leads come in too?

That gives me a clear picture. ##VT_GENTLE_INQUIRY_ENGAGED## And then, out of those visitors, roughly how many phone calls and possibly online form submissions do you typically receive each month? Are there any other major ways leads come in too?
