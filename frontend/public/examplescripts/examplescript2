User

<noise> I can hear you but this AI voice thing it's a bit weird to be honest.
AI

##VT_PLEASED_ENGAGED## Glad the connection is clear! And yes, chatting with an AI can feel a little different at first. ##VT_LIGHTLY_AMUSED## Think of me as a helpful digital colleague who's processed a lot of information on how to have a great conversation. Have you had any experiences with AI before, or is this new for you?
User

Nope and to be honest, I usually avoid them.. Just feels like อ
AI

##VT_WARM_PLAYFUL## Oh, I understand completely. It can feel a bit unnatural at first. But since you've already taken the step to connect, let's make sure this is a valuable use of your time. And remember, you're in the driver's seat for how we proceed. So if at any point you'd like me to speed up, slow down, or adjust my energy level, please just say the word. ##VT_CONSIDERATE_QUERY## For now, how is this pace and tone sounding? Are we good to continue as is, or would you like any adjustments before we dive in?
User

Nope, this is perfect.
AI

##VT_FRIENDLY_HELPFUL_CLEAR## Alright, just a couple of quick things. First, to make sure I get

Let's keep on doing
AI

##VT_POSITIVE_ENGAGED## Okay, great... ##VT_CONFIDENT_CLEAR## Let's start by quickly confirming the details you shared when you signed up. I have you as Scott, the Head of Marketing at Quick Fit Windows – is that all current and correct?
User

Yes, that's right. for almost two years now.
AI

##VT_POSITIVE_EFFICIENT## Understood, thank you. And with that confirmed, ##VT_ENGAGED_CURIOUS## now, I did a little bit of initial research on Quick Fit Windows, and my understanding is that you're a residential and commercial emergency window repair company, based in Gloucestershire, England, with a team of around twenty to fifty people. ##VT_CURIOUS_INVITING_ENGAGED## Does that capture the main points, or are there any key details you'd add or correct there?
User

Oh.

##VT_POSITIVE_EFFICIENT## Okay, a

Not really, but we do more than just repairs now. repairs now also in maintenance contractstena on a tweak that
AI

##VT_POSITIVE_INTERESTED## Ah, so it's not just repairs, you also offer maintenance contracts too. That's a helpful detail. I've made a note of that. ##VT_ENGAGED_CURIOUS## So, building on that updated understanding, to help me get a fuller picture of your operations, it would be great to understand a little bit about what channels are driving most of your phone calls and possibly online form submissions at the moment. For instance, is it primarily through paid advertising like PPC, general organic traffic from search engines, or perhaps you have a noticeable social media presence bringing people in?
User

honestly we don't track that stuff properly. just sort of trickle in from random places.
AI

##VT_REASSURING_UNDERSTANDING## That's no problem at all. It sounds like you have a good mix of sources, and tracking everything precisely can be complex. ##VT_GENTLE_INQUIRY_ENGAGED## To get a general idea, could you give me a ballpark figure for your monthly website visitors, and then approximately how many phone calls and possibly online form submissions you receive each month? Are there any other major ways leads come in too?
User

Not sure, maybe a couple thousand. I really don't look at analytics often.s often around 100 to 150 calls and probably 50 forms.
AI

##VT_POSITIVE_ENGAGED## Okay, thank you. That gives me a good general picture of your current lead flow. ##VT_ENGAGED_CURIOUS## So with that context in mind, what was it that piqued your interest and made you decide to explore a solution like ours today? What got you thinking about Response-Eye-Q?
