npm run test:unit          # Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:integration   # API integration tests
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end user flows
npm run test:accessibility # A11y compliance tests
npm run test:performance  # Performance benchmarks
```

**Quality Gates (Must Pass to Proceed):**
1. **Week 1**: Foundation tests pass, auth works, basic API functional
2. **Week 2**: Cleaning logic tests pass, JSON format correct, performance targets met
3. **Week 3**: Real-time tests pass, UI meets design standards, self-correction works
4. **Week 4**: All tests pass, production deployment successful, documentation complete

### Continuous Integration Pipeline

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks & Contingency Plans

**Technical Risks:**
1. **Gemini API Rate Limits**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement intelligent caching and request batching
   - *Contingency*: Switch to Claude or GPT-4 as backup

2. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust reconnection logic
   - *Contingency*: Fall back to polling for updates

3. **Performance Targets Not Met**
   - *Mitigation*: Daily performance monitoring and optimization
   - *Contingency*: Reduce feature scope to meet core requirements

4. **Testing Coverage Gaps**
   - *Mitigation*: Test-first development approach
   - *Contingency*: Extended testing period before deployment

**Schedule Risks:**
1. **Development Delays**
   - *Mitigation*: Daily progress tracking and early issue identification
   - *Contingency*: Reduce non-essential features, focus on core requirements

2. **Integration Issues**
   - *Mitigation*: Early integration testing and modular architecture
   - *Contingency*: Simplified integration approach if needed
