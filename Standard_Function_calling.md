> this is an example of a API communication between me and gemini 2.5 flash lite. I was wondering, if I'm using the function calling correctly? I mean, I have no problem, my backend successfully parses the function_calls from the response and I can see that it's actually applied. but I was wondering if I'm following the standards for this model's function calling capabilities?

> **Gemini:**
>
> Excellent question! This is a great topic to dig into because while your current method works, there's a more "standard" and robust way to use function calling with the Gemini API.
>
> Let's break down your example and then look at the recommended approach.
>
> ### Analysis of Your Current Implementation
>
> What you've done is a clever example of **prompt engineering**. You've essentially instructed the model in plain English to behave a certain way and to format its output as a JSON object that you can parse.
>
> **What You're Doing Right:**
>
> 1.  **Clear System Prompt:** Your `prompt_preview` ("You are an AI Analyst that calls functions...") is excellent. Providing a clear role and instructions is a best practice.
> 2.  **Successful Parsing:** The most important thing is that it works! Your backend can correctly parse the `function_calls` array, and the model is correctly identifying the user's intent.
> 3.  **Good Response Structure:** The `thought_process` is a fantastic idea for debugging and logging, showing the model's reasoning before it commits to a function call.
>
> **Where It Deviates from the "Standard":**
>
> The core difference is that you are *telling* the model to generate a function call via instructions in the prompt, rather than *equipping* the model with a list of available tools and letting it decide when to use them through the API's native `tools` and `tool_config` parameters.
>
> Your `function_call: "generateContent (function decision)"` field in the request looks like a custom instruction you've put into the top-level of the prompt, not a formal API parameter. The Gemini API doesn't have a parameter with this name. It works because the model is powerful enough to understand this instruction within the overall context.
>
> ---
>
> ### The Standard and Recommended Approach
>
> The official and more robust way to implement function calling is by using the `tools` and `tool_config` parameters in your API request. This method is more reliable because you are formally declaring the functions to the model, including their names, descriptions, and parameter schemas.
>
> Here’s how you would structure your request the "standard" way:
>
> **1. Define Your Tools:**
> You create a `FunctionDeclaration` for each function your application can execute. A good description is crucial, as the model uses it to decide which tool to use.
>
> **2. Include `tools` and `tool_config` in the API Call:**
> You pass the list of `FunctionDeclaration`s in the `tools` parameter of your request. You then use `tool_config` to tell the model *how* it should use those tools. `AUTO` is the most common setting, allowing the model to decide whether to call a function or respond with text.
>
> ### Example: Your Use Case the "Standard" Way
>
> Here is what your API call would look like using the recommended structure.
>
> **API Request Body:**

>
> **Expected Gemini API Response:**
>
> The response from the model would then look very similar to what you're already getting, but it's generated through this more formal mechanism. The `tool_calls` part is the key.
>
> ```json
> {
>   "candidates": [
>     {
>       "content": {
>         "parts": [
>           {
>             "functionCall": {
>               "name": "initiate_demo_creation",
>               "args": {}
>             }
>           }
>         ],
>         "role": "model"
>       }
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```
> *Note: The official response puts the function call inside `candidates[0].content.parts[0].functionCall`. Your SDK or proxy might be reformatting this into the `function_calls` array you're seeing, which is perfectly fine.*
>
> ### Why is the Standard Way Better?
>
> *   **Robustness:** The model doesn't have to guess the format. It knows exactly what functions are available and what their parameters are. This reduces errors, especially with complex functions that have multiple arguments.
> *   **Clarity:** The model's "thinking" is guided by the function descriptions you provide. A well-written description is the most effective way to ensure the correct function is called at the right time.
> *   **Maintainability:** As you add more functions, you just add them to the `tools` list. Your prompt can stay focused on the conversational context, rather than being cluttered with instructions about JSON formatting.
> *   **Future-Proofing:** This is the method Google documents and supports. As the models evolve, they will be optimized for this structure, ensuring your application remains compatible and performant.
>
> ### Conclusion
>
> **Yes, you are using function calling correctly in the sense that you've achieved your desired outcome.**
>
> However, to align with the **standard practices** for the Gemini API, you should adopt the `tools` and `tool_config` parameters. This will make your application more robust, easier to maintain, and better aligned with the intended use of the API. Your current method is a testament to the model's instruction-following capabilities, but the `tools` parameter is the purpose-built feature for this task.

> **User:**
>
> why I don't see the prompt there? also, "The user has confirmed they are ready for the demo and has asked for it to be sent over, which is an explicit consent to create the demo." it's from the model's response! I've had them go through their Thought process so I can study and optimize the prompts.

> **Gemini:**
>
> You are absolutely correct! My apologies, I misinterpreted your initial JSON. Thank you for the clarification—it makes your implementation even more interesting.
>
> Let's break this down again with the correct understanding.
>
> *   **Your Prompt:** Is the `prompt_preview` you showed: `"You are an AI Analyst that calls functions..."`.
> *   **The User's Input:** Is a separate message, something like "Okay, send it over."
> *   **The Model's Output:** Is the JSON you provided, which includes the `thought_process` you engineered and the `function_calls` you need.
>
> This is a very common and effective workflow. Now let's answer your two excellent follow-up questions.
>
> ---
>
> ### 1. "Why I don't see the prompt there?"
>
> You are right, I didn't include your system prompt in my example. My mistake.
>
> In the standard Gemini API, there isn't a dedicated `system` role like in some other models. The way you provide a system prompt or instructions is by making it the **very first message in the conversation history**. The model is trained to treat the initial turn as the primary set of instructions for the entire conversation.
>
> So, to correctly use the standard `tools` approach while *also* giving the model your "AI Analyst" persona, the API call should look like this.
>
> **Corrected "Standard" API Call (with your prompt):**
>
> ```json
> {
>   "contents": [
>     {
>       "role": "user",
>       "parts": [
>         {
>           "text": "You are an AI Analyst that calls functions based on a conversation. Follow these rules exactly. 1. ANALYZE THE LATEST EXCHANGE... etc."
>         }
>       ]
>     },
>     {
>       "role": "model",
>       "parts": [
>         {
>           "text": "Understood. I am an AI Analyst ready to assist."
>         }
>       ]
>     },
>     {
>       "role": "user",
>       "parts": [
>         {
>           "text": "Okay I'm ready, send it over!"
>         }
>       ]
>     }
>   ],
>   "tools": [
>     {
>       "function_declarations": [
>         {
>           "name": "initiate_demo_creation",
>           "description": "Starts the process of creating and sending a product demo when the user explicitly agrees or asks for it.",
>           "parameters": { "type": "OBJECT", "properties": {} }
>         }
>       ]
>     }
>   ],
>   "tool_config": {
>     "function_calling_config": { "mode": "AUTO" }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> ---
>
> ### 2. "The 'thought process' is from the model's response!"
>
> This is the most important part of your clarification. You have successfully engineered the prompt to make the model output an extra piece of data (`thought_process`) for your logging and optimization. **This is a great use of prompt engineering!**
>
> Here's the key trade-off:
>
> *   **Your Current Method (Prompt Engineering):** You tell the model to return a specific JSON structure, including your custom `thought_process` field.
>     *   **Pro:** You get this valuable metadata for debugging and analysis.
>     *   **Con:** It's slightly less robust. The model is following text instructions to create the JSON. If the prompt is complex or the model version changes, it might occasionally fail to create the perfect JSON structure.
>
> *   **Standard Method (Using `tools`):** You use the API's native `tools` feature.
>     *   **Pro:** Extremely robust and reliable. The model's output for `functionCall` is a guaranteed, well-structured object, not just text formatted as JSON.
>     *   **Con:** The native response will **not** include your custom `thought_process` field. The API will only return the `functionCall` itself.
>
> ### How to Get the Best of Both Worlds?
>
> If the `thought_process` is critical for your application, you have two excellent options:
>
> **Option A: Stick with your current method.**
> It's working for you! It's clever and achieves your goal. Just be aware that it relies on prompt engineering and you may need to add robust error handling on your backend in case the model returns malformed JSON.
>
> **Option B (Recommended Hybrid): A Two-Call Approach**
> This gives you maximum reliability and the metadata you want.
>
> 1.  **First API Call (Generate Thought Process):** Make a call to the model with a prompt specifically designed to generate *only* the thought process.
> 2.  **Second API Call (Generate Function Call):** Make the API call exactly as shown in the **Corrected "Standard" API Call** example above, using the `tools` parameter.
>
> This hybrid approach separates the task of "thinking" from the task of "tool selection," using the best method for each and giving you rock-solid reliability.

> Lumen: Understood, thank you. And with that confirmed, now, I did a little bit of initial research on Quick Fit Windows, and my understanding is that you're a residential and commercial emergency window repair company, based in Gloucestershire, England, with a team of around twenty to fifty people. Does that capture the main points, or are there any key details you'd add or correct there?

> User: Not really, but we do more than just repairs now. We also do maintenance contracts.
> Lumen: Ah, so it's not just repairs, you also offer maintenance contracts too. That's a helpful detail. I've made a note of that. So, building on that updated understanding, to help me get a fuller picture of your operations, it would be great to understand a little bit about what channels are driving most of your phone calls and possibly online form submissions at the moment. For instance, is it primarily through paid advertising like PPC, general organic traffic from search engines, or perhaps you have a noticeable social media presence bringing people in?
> User: honestly we don't track that stuff properly. just sort of trickle in from random places.
> Lumen: That's no problem at all. It sounds like you have a good mix of sources, and tracking everything precisely can be complex. To get a general idea, could you give me a ballpark figure for your monthly website visitors, and then approximately how many phone calls and possibly online form submissions you receive each month? Are there any other major ways leads come in too?
> User: Not sure, maybe a couple thousand. I really don't look at analytics often. It's often around 100 to 150 calls and probably 50 forms.
> Lumen: Okay, thank you. That gives me a good general picture of your current lead flow. So with that context in mind, what was it that piqued your interest and made you decide to explore a solution like ours today? What got you thinking about Response-Eye-Q?

The personalized demo we're creating will show you how tools like our Callback Widget can help capture those potential leads and ensure quick responses. Based on that, would you be ready for me to go ahead and create that personalized demo environment for you?
> User: I guess as long as it's not a long sales pitch.
> Lumen: Not at all! This demo is designed specifically for Quick Fit Windows, focusing on how our platform can address the potential missed leads you mentioned. It's a quick, personalized overview. So I'll go ahead and create that personalized demo for you now. Does that sound like a good next step?

> **Gemini:**
>
> Thank you so much for sharing the full prompt. This is an absolutely fantastic example of advanced prompt engineering and provides perfect context. I see exactly what you're doing now, and my previous advice needs to be adjusted.
>
> Given this full prompt, let's re-evaluate.
>
> ### Analysis of Your Prompt Structure
>
> You have built a complete, self-contained system within the prompt. It's not just a "prompt"; it's a full request template that provides:
>
> 1.  **Persona & Rules:** Clear, strict instructions for the "AI Analyst."
> 2.  **Output Schema:** A non-negotiable JSON format (`thought_process`, `function_calls`).
> 3.  **State & Context:** The `[CALL CONTEXT]` gives the model the current state of the world.
> 4.  **History:** The `[CONVERSATION HISTORY]` lets it analyze the latest user utterance.
> 5.  **Available Tools:** The `[TOOL CATALOGUE]` is a text-based version of what would normally go in the API's `tools` parameter.
> 6.  **De-duplication Logic:** The `previous_function_calls` section is a brilliant way to prevent the model from repeating actions.
>
> This is a very sophisticated "one-shot" approach where you give the model everything it needs to perform a complex reasoning task and return a structured response, all in a single API call.
>
> ### Answering Your Core Question: "Am I using function calling correctly?"
>
> With this new information, the answer changes slightly but significantly:
>
> **No, you are not using the Gemini API's *native* function calling feature. Instead, you have successfully *replicated* the behavior of function calling through meticulous prompt engineering.**
>
> Let's be very clear: **This is not a bad thing.** It is an impressive and effective way to achieve your goal. You have traded the use of the native API feature for a higher degree of control over the output format (specifically, getting that `thought_process` key).
>
> ### Why Your Method Works So Well
>
> *   **Total Control:** You dictate the *exact* JSON output. The native `tools` feature would only return the function call part, not your custom `thought_process` key.
> *   **Context Injection:** You've found a robust way to inject state, history, and a tool list directly into the model's reasoning context.
> *   **Instruction Following:** Gemini models, especially Flash and Pro, are excellent at following complex instructions and format requirements like this. Your prompt is clear, well-structured with `[START]` and `[END]` tags, and uses strong directives ("You MUST").
>
> ### The Trade-Offs: Your Method vs. Native `tools`
>
> | Feature | Your Prompt Engineering Method | Native `tools` API Method |
> | :--- | :--- | :--- |
> | **Primary Goal** | Generate a specific JSON object with `thought_process` and `function_calls`. | Identify the correct function to call from a predefined list. |
> | **Reliability** | **High, but not 100%.** Relies on the model's ability to perfectly follow text instructions. A model update could subtly change its interpretation. | **Very High (near 100%).** The output is a structured object, not formatted text. It's guaranteed to be parseable. |
> | **Output Control** | **Excellent.** You get your custom `thought_process` key. | **Limited.** You only get the `functionCall` object. You cannot ask for extra keys like `thought_process`. |
> | **Tool Definition** | Tools are defined as text inside the prompt's `[TOOL CATALOGUE]` section. | Tools are defined as structured `FunctionDeclaration` objects in the API's `tools` parameter. |
> | **Cost / Tokens** | **Higher.** Your prompt is very large because it includes the entire tool catalog and history every single time. | **Potentially Lower.** The `tools` definition is handled by the API backend. While it still consumes tokens, it's often more optimized. |
> | **Complexity** | **High in the prompt.** You have to manage the entire prompt structure, including escaping JSON within strings. | **High in the code.** You have to build the `FunctionDeclaration` objects in your backend code, but the prompt itself becomes much simpler. |
>
> ### Recommendation and Conclusion
>
> **You have a great system. You are using the model's capabilities correctly for your chosen method.**
>
> Since the `thought_process` key is clearly a critical requirement for your application, **sticking with your current method is a perfectly valid and powerful choice.** You have prioritized output control over using the native API feature, and it's working.
>
> **If you wanted to migrate to the native `tools` feature, you would have to:**
>
> 1.  **Simplify your prompt:** Remove the `[TOOL CATALOGUE]` and the strict `OUTPUT FORMAT` rules.
> 2.  **Move the tool definitions:** Convert your `[TOOL CATALOGUE]` JSON into `FunctionDeclaration` objects and pass them in the API's `tools` parameter.
> 3.  **Lose the `thought_process` key:** The API will no longer return this for you in the same call. You would have to implement the two-call approach I mentioned earlier (one call for thought, one for the function call) if you still wanted that metadata.
>
> Given that your current system handles context, history, and de-duplication so well, and gives you the exact output you need, my final assessment is: **You have built a highly effective, custom function-calling system using advanced prompt engineering. You are not using the *native* feature, but you are absolutely using the *model* correctly and effectively.** There is no compelling reason to change unless you start experiencing reliability issues (e.g., malformed JSON) or find the token cost of the large prompt to be a problem.

> **User:**
>
> so, basically, converting this to a traditional and standard function call API call should be very easy, right? can you give me an example based on what I shared?

> **Gemini:**
>
> Yes, you are absolutely right. Converting your current setup to use the standard, native function calling API is very straightforward because you have already done all the hard work of defining the tools and logic. You're essentially just moving the pieces to their "official" places in the API request.
>
> Here is a concrete example of how you would transform your last prompt into a standard Gemini API call.
>
> ### Step 1: Separate the Components from Your Prompt
>
> First, we'll break down your big prompt into the logical pieces the API expects:
>
> 1.  **System Instructions:** The rules and persona for the AI Analyst.
> 2.  **Conversation History:** The back-and-forth between Lumen and the User.
> 3.  **Tool Declarations:** The JSON definitions from your `[TOOL CATALOGUE]`.
> 4.  **Function Results (for context):** The information from your `previous_function_calls` block. This is a crucial and often overlooked part of multi-turn function calling.
>
> ### Step 2: Build the Standard API Request
>
> Here is the complete JSON body for the API request. I've added comments to explain each section.
>
> ```json
> {
>   // The 'contents' array holds the entire conversation history.
>   "contents": [
>     // ======== 1. SYSTEM PROMPT / INITIAL INSTRUCTIONS ========
>     // We start the conversation with your rules. This sets the context for the model.
>     {
>       "role": "user",
>       "parts": [
>         {
>           "text": "You are an AI Analyst. Your job is to analyze conversations and call functions to log new or corrected facts. Only use the provided tools. If the user's message contains no new facts (e.g., 'yes', 'okay') or if you are not 100% sure, do not call any function."
>         }
>       ]
>     },

>         }
>       ]
>     },
>
>     // ======== 2. CONVERSATION HISTORY ========
>     // We add the rest of the conversation history turn-by-turn.
>     // I've condensed it slightly for readability, but you would include the full history.

>     { "role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "User: Not really, but we do more than just repairs now. We also do maintenance contracts."}] },
>
>     // ======== 3. PREVIOUS FUNCTION CALL & RESULT (VERY IMPORTANT!) ========

>           }
>         }

>     // The history ends here. The model will now respond to "Just send it over."

> ### Expected API Response
>
> The response you would get from the Gemini API would look like this. Notice it's much cleaner and is not a string that you have to parse as JSON. Your SDK would give you direct access to these structured objects.
>
> ```json
> {
>   "candidates": [
>     {
>       "content": {
>         "parts": [
>           {
>             "functionCall": {
>               "name": "initiate_demo_creation",
>               "args": {}
>             }
>           }
>         ],
>         "role": "model"
>       },
>       "finishReason": "TOOL_CALL",
>       "index": 0,
>       "safetyRatings": []
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> ### Key Differences and Advantages of this Method
>
> 1.  **Cleaner Prompt:** Your `contents` array is now just the conversation. All the tool definitions are moved to the `tools` parameter, making the prompt itself smaller and more focused.
> 2.  **Explicit Tool Turns:** The `role: "tool"` is the standard way to tell the model the result of a past function call. This is critical for preventing loops and letting the model know what actions have already been taken successfully.
> 3.  **Guaranteed Structure:** The `functionCall` in the response is a structured object, not just text. You will never get a malformed JSON error.
> 4.  **No `thought_process`:** As discussed, the one thing you "lose" is the `thought_process` key. If you need it, you would make a separate, preliminary API call asking the model to reason about its next step.
>
> This conversion is a direct mapping of your well-designed prompt into the API's formal structure. It should give you more reliable and predictable behavior from the API.
